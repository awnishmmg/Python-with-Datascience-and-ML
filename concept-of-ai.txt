AI : it is branch of computer science namely known as "Artificial Intelligence",
	 whose main aim to predict,behave and mimic,think like humans.
	 "Artificial" is related to main-made.
	 
	 we want to build machine(Intelligence Machine) which could persist/copy the 
	 Intelligence like humans.
	 
	 Intelligence System :-
	 1. General AI : it some what like human it makes mistake on the basis 
	 trial and error and it learns from mistake.
	 
	 Human ----> Mistake ----> Learning
	 confidence Score (effeciency) (0,1) 0r (0 to 100%)
	 like effeciency can never 100% confidence will also Range = 0<cf(s)<1
	 effeciency = output
				  ------
				  input 
	  cf(s)  =  Output case   Output Dataset By Agent
				----------- = -----------------------
				 input case    Input Dataset (csv,sql)
		At Every iterations cf(s) factor will increase.
		
		logic = Predicate Logic
		Rules keeps changing 
		Baye's(Naive Baye's) Theoram of Probability 
		
	 2. Rule Based
			This not a exactly a Ai but it behave turing machine.
			Every program you make in computer will act as Turing machine.
			Program take some set input perform computation on in the input
			on the basis context free grammer (rules) for the defined 
			set of states.(finite states).

			cf(s) = 0 or 1
		logic = digital logic 
		1. probability of possible event (must)
		2. probability of impossible event (never)
		Rules fixed.
		
Design a Turing Machine Named Munna which can convert any number into numeric words.
The Problem statement : NLP (Natural Langauge Processing)

41 divide 10 
q = 4

q*10 = 40 => tens = ['ten','twenty','thirty','forty']
r = 1

units = ['zero','one','two','three','four','five','six','seven','eight','nine']
number_word = tens[q-1]
next_word = units[r]

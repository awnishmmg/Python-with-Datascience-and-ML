	==================
	What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)

	AI is field of CS that aims to build such machines which can copy/mimic/replicate/imitate the human Intelligence

	Myth:-
	machines : Do-not consider AI to be as Iron Man Suit 
	Machine : can be simple script, a simple bot, or Some Highfi Machine like Robot.

	What comes under human Intelligence?
	1. creative thinking or cognative thinking.
	2. decision Making
	3. learning (learning from mistakes)
	4. problem solving.

	Al at current Aug 2025, No AI can be as creative as human.
	Ai propotype Human 

	Real Life Example or Use cases:-
	==========================
	1.  Google Map :- 
		1. traffic detection.
		2. Path Detection and Optimisation.
	2. Chatbots  : chatgpt (intially 1.0 Now it all-rounder)
	3. self-driving car like Tesla : (Tesla Autopilot)
		Air-Planes already have auto-pilot mode.
	4. Face ID Unlock.
	...
	...
	...

	Branches of AI :
	=====================
	1. ML (Machine Learning)
	2. Computer Vision : Highly Challan Camera.
	3. NLP : Natural Langaue Processing 
	4. DL : (Deep Learning)
	5. Robotics. (chitti..,terminator)

	Difference Between Automatic Machine and AI ?
	1.   Automatic Machine : effeciency = 100%
	2.   AI Machines : effeciency < 100%

	Errors,  100 times -> Same Error 
    at every error it will evolve it self. like human

	classificaiton of AI :-
	===============================
	classification of AI is based on reliability & capability(ability) & effeciency.
	and trust value.

									-capability       			Agent
	1. Narrow AI :  				Task Specific.    			Google Assitant,Siri,Alexa.
	2. General AI/Fictious AI     Human Level Intelligence
											 &
								Human Level Adaption and Behaviour. Jarvis or Chitti
								
	3. Super AI :     Super Human Ability 							ultron,Nebula,
																 Her Movie(Science ficiton)

	Research Paper : Research/Learning/study.(perpexility.ai)

	Which is first AI Machine?

	Automata (TOC) : Last Unit : Turing Machine.
	Turing Machine : first theoratical Machine and this is ultimate
	which gives basic foundation any computation.

	Nobel Prize: Award Turing Award -> Alen Turing -> Turing Machine.
	Term Launch ? Can Machine think like Humans.
	Elon Mask : AI Driven Machine : Tesla -> "Mark My Words, Ai is far dangerous than we think"

	We are living Narrow AI 
	=========================
	History/Evolution  : Homework.

	Classificaiton of AI in ML,DL, NLP?
	=====================================
	Machine Learning:- 
	it is Technique/way/process by which computer learns from data, insteading
	predined Rules.

	we have many system which can learn from data and perform 
	task. How are they different from ML.
	Eg: computer Game Playing, of Teken 3 

	ML should not use, Hardcoded Rules, Patterns.
	In Ml we provide data and label set (Yes or No)
	Automatically Identify the Pattern and Learn.

	Types of MLS :-
	1. SL (Supervised Learning)
	2. USL (Un-Super Vised Learning)
	3. RL (Re-inforcement Learning)


    These learning are classified on the basis of data structures 
    as we know that we 3 types of data 
    1. labelled or structured data 
    2. un-labelled or un-structured data
    3. semi-structured data. (labelled and un-labelled)

	In Real Life we have cases of Semi-Supervised Learning?
	1. structured : classify 
	2. unstructred : -> new Pattern identify -> Emdeddings(vectors) -> Nearest
	Neibhhood or Nearest Node Search (Graphs Algorithms.)

	Core of AI : a Core of AI can be assumed a mathematical function f(x) which has some input I and 
	called as Indepedent variable (Independent Features)
	Output variables/output Pairs (dependent Features.)

	y=f(x)
	y dependent variable 
	x independent 

	y = 4x (x=1,2,3,...)

	SL (Supervised Learning) 
	===========================
	1.Labelled Learning 
	2. Learn from Label Data 
	Eg : images 
			1 Apple   2 Orange 
			
	or 
	Supervised Learning is a type of learning which is done under some mentorship(under supervision)

	Example :- Super vised learning 
	1. House Price Prediciton 

	Features/data : size(1 BHK,2 BHK),location
	Label : Price 

	Algorithms:-
	===========================
	1. Linear Regression (for prediction)
	2. Logistic Regression (for classification)

	Eg:- Email -> subject line -> "You won Lottery " ->
		1. spam 
		2. Ham (Not a Spam)
		Filters -> classifiy -> emails of spam and not spam 
		
	3. Decision Tree(*imp)
	4. Random Forest (**vvp)
	5. Support Vector Machine(svm)

	Use case How we can use Logistic Regression in Spam Detection?
	1. Input(FI): 
			email subject/email body ---> Regrex/text Processing
											|
											|
										corpus (message or paragraph)
											|
										documents (sentences)
											|
										words/unique words
											|
										vacubalary
											|
										context free grammer
											|
											|
										Feature Extract
											|
											Model 
											(Train)
											|
											|
										classification
											|
										Predict
											|
										spam or not 
											
					 
	un-supervised Learning:-
	The type of learning in which system learns without any supervision
	or mentorship.

	data + but not label
	1. we have data but no labels.	
	what is our end goal : Identify the hidden Patterns or Structure,
	or symmetry.

	Example:-
	customer Identify In Retail Service.

	Features : Age,income,spending
	Identify : Luxury Buyer, Budget Buyer, commericial Buyer and
	Residencial Buyer.

	Algorithms:-
	1. K Means clustering
	2. Hieririchal Classification or clustering
	3. DBSCAN 
	4. PCA (Dimension Reduction)***

	12-06-2025:-
	==============
	Re-inforcement Learning:-
	This is Ml Algorithms, Agents or computer or machine learns from rewards and 
	punishment.

	How Model will work:-
	1. we have Model --> data set ---> Train (Input Feature & Output Feature)
	2. Operation -> win cases or loss case lossedcases_data  = []
	3. lossedcases_data -> train -> operation --> win & lossed.

	Reward Driven.
	use case :- Chess Game,Mario,Contro.

	How the life cycle of reinforcment learning goes:-

	1. Environment 
	2. Actions
	3. Reward/Goal
	4. updates Policy

	chess Board : Board Environment 
	Pyadey : actions 
	Reward/Goal : 

	Algorithm:-
	===============
	1. Q Learning 
	2. Deep Q Networks (DQN)
	3. Policy Gradient 
	4. Tensor Gradient 
	5. PPO, A3C

	Simple Explaination by Mahabharat:-
	1. Arjun -> warriour -> learning -> Guru Dronacharya.
		supervised Learning
	2. Eklawya -> warriour -> learned -> archery without ->  Guru Dronacharya
		learned without present of Guru Dronacharya
		un-supervised learning
	3. Karan : No At last very last stage, of Karan he was trained by 
		Guru Parusharam
		
		Karan -> very talented since child hood, he learned everything
		by implementation.
		he made mistake and learned lot.
		Re-inforcement - Learning.
		
	Re-inforcement Learning is inspired from environment.
	small childrens are best example of Re-inforcement Learning.

	Frog, Chockroach, Lizard, 
	Chotey Bacche 

	Mathematical Impression of Reinformcement Learning:-
	======================================================
	Chess Game in Terms Reinformcement Learning :-

	RL : agent -> at initial level it make not take correct action.
	Example :-> you can step wrong step, under the affect Environment and its consequences
	these result will decide what will be next step.-> as you become -> more 
	open to Environment -> you become more cleaver.

	what is our learning creteria ?
	1. trail and Error (TE Algorithm)
	2. we donot have any labelled data.

	Re-inforcement learning is kind of un-super vised learning where at intial level
	we donot have any lebeled data, but as we interact with Environment our 
	action to Environment result to effect.
	and effect for next time will becomes data.

	Re-inforcement is Recursive in Nature.
	your past action will act as input data for next step.

	Applying Mathematical Represenation of Chess in RL:-
	=====================================================
	RL Component     			|  chess Board 
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Agent               			Chess Player X -> Y (Opponent -> Agent)
	Environment      			|  Chess Board and Rules
	Intial State     			|  intial Position of pawn.
	(Finite state of            |
	Automata)                   |
								|
	Action/Moves                | A Legal Move of Queen, Bishop, Elephant,Horse.
	Reward                      | +1 for win, 0 draw ,
								|   
	loss                        |  win by opponent 

	<--------------------------1 chance ------------------------->

	Policy (pi)                 |  strategy change 
	Strategy 

	value f(x)                  | strategy, Actions -> Reward/loss
	End Goal
									V of f(x) => R(f(S,A))


	Q Factor/Functions = State + Action.

	Write a Sudo Code for the RL in Chess Game:-
	================================================
	max_reward = 16
	is_game_running = True  #false value of is_game_running : Game over 
	while is_game_running:
		state = get_current_position(x,y) #x Player X and Y : Opponent
		action  = move_steps(state(x))
		new_state,reward = next_steps_with_result(action)
		if(reward):
			state = get_current_position(x,y)
			action  = move_steps(state(x))
		elif(reward == max_reward)
			is_game_running = False 
			break;
		elif(state == new_state):
			if action == False 
				game_draw()
				is_game_running = False 
				break;
		else:
			update_strategy(state,action,reward,new_state)
